<hr> <pre> The card game *Screw* (لعبة سكرو), a web-based game inspired by a game created by YouTuber Yehia Azzam, is a competitive and strategic game designed for multiple players. The game involves a special deck of cards with unique rules that encourage strategic thinking, bluffing, and teamwork. Players compete to outsmart each other by making calculated moves, aiming to accumulate the least points possible or force opponents into difficult situations. It's a small, fun project where you can try it yourself here: https://amr-yasser.itch.io/screw </pre> <hr>
